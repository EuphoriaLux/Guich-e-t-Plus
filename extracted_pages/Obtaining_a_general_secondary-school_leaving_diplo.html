<p>The eBac, or 'blended-learning' programme, is a programme offered by the Ministry of Education, Children, and Youth (<em>ministère de l’Éducation nationale, de l'Enfance et de la Jeunesse</em>), in which 25 % of the programme is delivered at a high school and 75 % delivered online, and which leads to a secondary school leaving diploma (baccalaureate) in the "Modern G" section of the classic secondary school education system.</p>
<p>This program is intended for <strong>adults</strong> who never completed secondary school and would like to return to complete their secondary education. It is also intended for students in the classic secondary education system who have successfully completed the fourth-class year (usually around the age of 15). The eBac courses cover the last 3 years of the secondary education "Modern G" section (human and social sciences) programme, and are quite flexible, which makes them easier for adults to cope with as they balance the demands of their job, family life, and school.<sup></sup></p>
<p>The eBac is composed of several modules. Generally, each module lasts 8 weeks. Each 8-week period is called a 'session'. Each year consists of <strong>6 sessions</strong> in all.</p>
<h2>Who is concerned</h2>
<p>The following may be candidates for the eBac:</p>
<ul>
<li>students enrolled in a Luxembourgish school who are at least 16 years old and have completed the fourth-class year of general secondary education;<sup></sup></li>
<li>adults who left the school system without having taken the baccalaureate exam and who wish to complete the classic secondary education programme.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>To be admitted into the third-class year (<i>3e</i>) of secondary education, candidates must have successfully completed the fourth-class year (<i>4e</i>). Where this is not the case, candidates must submit an application for admission on the <a href="http://www.ebacsite.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="The eBac eLearning Platform website - New window">eBac eLearning Platform</a>. In certain cases, after examining their applications, the eBac committee may decide to assess students' knowledge of French, German, English, and mathematics.<sup></sup><sup></sup> The purpose of the assessment is to evaluate student's skills and decide whether enrolment in a third-class year programme is appropriate.<sup></sup></p>
</div>
<h2>How to proceed</h2>
<h3>eBac structure and curriculum</h3>
<p>The eBac offers the official 'G Section' (human and social sciences) curriculum to students at the following levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" title="third-class year - Curriculum">third-class year</a> (<i>3e</i>);</li>
<li><a title="second-class year - Curriculum">second-class year</a> (<i>2e</i>);</li>
<li><a target="_blank" title="first-class year - Curriculum">first-class year</a> (<i>1re</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about the official educational programs offered by the eBac, select the desired class in the 'Secondary Education (<i>Enseignement secondaire</i>) tab, then click on 'Show curricula' (<i>Afficher programmes</i>).</p>
<p>Additionally, details on the specific features of the eBac curriculum as compared with the classic curriculum may be viewed on the <a href="http://www.ebacsite.net/modules/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="eBac Curriculum - New window">eBac Portal</a>.</p>
<h4>Modular instruction</h4>
<p>eBac courses are offered as <strong>modules</strong>. Of the modules in each level of study, students ('eLearners' or 'eLs') are free to choose as many as they like, and to set their own pace for completing them.</p>
<p>Depending on their skills, their learning speed, and their organisational constraints, eLearners may enrol for several modules at once, which enables them progress more quickly in their education and to shorten the theoretical duration of study (which is 1 year per level).</p>
<div class="highlight">
 Each module will always be offered at least once per academic year. Those modules that must be passed to advance to the next level may be offered a second time if the number of students enrolled for them is sufficient to justify doing so. It should be noted that even if a module is not offered a second time, the test relating to the module will be. As such, the student will be able to retake the test in the same academic year.
 <br/>
<br/>
</div>
<h4>Procedures for assessments and the final examination</h4>
<p>In-class testing is organised during the 7th week of each session.<sup></sup> These tests enable the eLearner to complete a module which, if the eLearner's average is high enough, will be counted towards their progression. Students who, at the end of the session, do not feel ready for the test, and who are enrolled in the module as 'free students,' may choose not to complete the in-class test, but instead to sit for the same test 8 weeks later. In-class testing must be organised every 8 weeks.</p>
<p>The final examination permits eLearners to earn a secondary school leaving diploma (baccalaureate) that is identical to the one awarded in the traditional education system.</p>
<h3>eBac enrolment procedure</h3>
<h4>Enrolment periods</h4>
<p>There are no set enrolment periods. Interested individuals may apply at any time of year for admission to the next session, subject to having enrolled online and submitted their application <strong>15 days before</strong> the start of the session.</p>
